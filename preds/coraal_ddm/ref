DCB_se1_ag3_f_01_1_333418_343444 oh well nobody knows i guess people got tired of soliciting help and you know some of the dynamics changed where neighbors just were getting older and didn't want to do it anymore
DCB_se1_ag3_f_01_1_682434_731413 that used to be what we used to call the market we used to can go down there and it was different little e sh stands inside of there we could shop for hair goods t shirts you they had a place in there that had the best f ch steak and cheese i mean these are all the things that we saw you know we've seen change over the years the um corner store that sits right there next to kipp used to be a people's drug store and if you go further up benning road on the left hand side right there i think that's benning road and h that used to be the only black owned record store on this side of town and it was called anne's record shop and then where the hair braiding place is now that used to be a cleaners and then the twenty four hour store used to be an actual seven eleven
DCB_se1_ag3_f_01_1_94738_99958 and high school i went to and
DCB_se1_ag3_f_02_2_541814_589575 yes but all us work i have a uh friend she's a police officer that's my best friend we went to hair school together w basically we did everything together until she went into the police force um back in high school i still talk to um some of my friends from the basketball team uh uh me and her close but uh we have our families she live out clinton so we see each other when we go to church sometimes and we talk on the phone but when we get together it's always the same so we know that you know we are true friends cause it alway the s always the same when we see each other but all in all i stays in the house trying to get them book works done that's it
DCB_se1_ag3_m_02_1_1458301_1496422 yeah each each band has their significant style i mean but they're all played on the same instrument of course every band's going to have a different style like chuck brown'd be like more slow pace or you know you had more slow pace for the older crowd cause they wasn't with all that but you know junk back and northeast groovers you know they could go slow or they'll go fast for a couple dances or something like that for back in the day but i'll tell you one thing we don't percolate that's what we won't do down in d c we don't percolate
DCB_se1_ag3_m_02_1_1563477_1588686 yeah it was more like a sacrificial type thing they wasn't really radio oriented radio stations weren't playing go go like that it was one band that got on though who was it uh e u who was that band e u and that was aight used to crank too though remember working the
DCB_se1_ag3_m_02_1_683270_732731 like as as far as you know letting the government just do anything that they want to do basically cause nobody's really there to fight for us or you know actually see what really goes down behind closed doors i mean yeah we have people on television telling us one thing but they could just be being a puppet for the next man but we really wouldn't know until we able to fight for the cause and get what we want right inf in in front of us so it'll be shown instead of going off what everybody else is saying and it's going the other way but the whole plan was to go the other way the whole time but you'll never be able to know that until you open your eyes
DCB_se1_ag4_m_02_1_1546069_1555346 in uh second grade teacher gave me nickname snake cause well she said i was sneaky you know i'd be sitting in one place and she turn around i'm sitting some place else

DCB_se2_ag2_m_01_1_2643045_2659720 that's a story within itself i have two two little girls by two different uh mothers so that that that set me back a little bit from from going back to school because i i was i was ready to go back to school but had them babies and that that took my my m my money went to that

PRV_se0_ag3_f_02_2_1292288_1297951 and you know we we found kids during that time years ago that was in really bad shape
PRV_se0_ag3_f_02_2_1965995_1971167 and it was really really getting ready to fall in and they had a traveler travel trailer
PRV_se0_ag3_f_02_2_816661_829223 my mom w um you know sh when she was h had the store and she would used to close the store about uh eleven o clock and she would uh promise us now when we're closed up we're just going to take a ride and look at the town

PRV_se0_ag3_m_01_1_1239328_1249532 but at the same time they need to be gently awakened to say well the only way we can get past that is to address it
PRV_se0_ag3_m_01_1_1266334_1283477 well this place from what i've been told um f w was first called freedom hill and um i can imagine my great great grandparents were part of those um first freed um slaves that would settle here
PRV_se0_ag3_m_01_1_1321129_1339820 uh and so all of a sudden i guess someone assigned said well that's a safe haven for them because jim crowism was still going on that the some of the southerners just was bitter about taking their free free slave labor away from 'em

ROC_se0_ag1_f_01_1_1786399_1804459 i'm i'm not worry about a confederate flag flying you know across my face or driving behind somebody and they spit on my car because i'm black you know but the and my brother has told me about things that have happened just because he's black so i don't worry about that here so i'm thankful for that i should say
ROC_se0_ag1_f_01_1_2685915_2720794 about so it depends um but i think it here i feel like a lot of people are from down south a lot of people have come up to rochester in particular because of job opportunities and different things at the time so most of everybody i know has roots somewhere else they aren't actually born here i can't trace anybody back that i know of that was just has always been here which makes sense in history unless somebody's family was an indentured servant i don't really know anybody that was born and just bred here
ROC_se0_ag1_f_01_1_2814366_2829390 if that makes sense and they don't get a lot of my references like jokes or um i can't think of anything right now but things i would say they'd be like who if i were to say who shot john you know you know what i'm talking about
ROC_se0_ag1_f_01_1_453489_469577 a lot of the kids i went to elementary from i was overweight growing up so a lot of the kids were going to wilson and i didn't want to go because they used to tease me all the time so i didn't want to go to wilson and i didn't want to go to a all girls school cause i was like great i'm never going to have a boyfriend
ROC_se0_ag1_f_02_1_1117598_1130479 like three or four people that i knew in college like pretty well and i had no idea that they were there and i had just got to d c so i was trying to kind of build my network of people um so i'm glad i went
ROC_se0_ag1_f_02_1_422637_464536 um it was challenging because i think at that point um so when i entered i was like thirteen thirteen or fourteen and i think at that point i started to realize that you know not everybody's so like uh let me take a step back so i would participate in different community service activities so one of the things that we did is like interact with like um sch students that went to like suburban high schools and so i think like going to their facilities and stuff like that i noticed like started to notice differences between like the schools like my school and their school so like my school you know soon as you walk before you can get into the school you have to go through medical medical uh
ROC_se0_ag1_f_03_1_1654023_1664888 i would do those and i would be really happy doing it i just like now i know and if i have a kid like i'll just try not to make their life hell and make them feel like they can stay
ROC_se0_ag1_f_03_1_2721964_2731344 um i think that like places deep on the west side and deep on the east side are probably like in the city
ROC_se0_ag1_f_03_1_868173_881744 so if you combine that with uh a career goal that it it it only reaches success if someone likes the way you look you could be
ROC_se0_ag1_m_01_1_1094303_1131206 um honestly my mom picked every single school that i went to um so it started of with pre k at and then i went to um from k through second after i went to from third until six at is where i started realizing why i was different from other people cause like i was in fourth grade literally like a week and they come up to me and are like have you ever heard about the and i'm like no
ROC_se0_ag1_m_01_1_1473998_1493891 then i'll teach you calculus and i'm like okay so first you know i'm not really learning nothing because i'm not teaching well but eventually um he taught me he taught me calculus and i'm sitting here i'm like okay derivatives huh okay and um the thing about is we don't take regents
ROC_se0_ag1_m_01_1_1997487_2005526 um like the education i got from was was top tier
ROC_se0_ag1_m_01_1_2542169_2591051 doing music integration and yeah i'm like it it it was it was nice it was really nice but i was really looking for my thing was what i started realizing um as in is like you make progress with kids but then like something may happen at home that you have no idea about and they come the next day and it's just like yo what's going on something could have happened um at i'm allowed to i have that connection with the home the school the student the parent and it's like that full circle so i feel like right now i'm finally at that place where i'm this is the job that i want like this is how i feel like i can really make some type of impact or change amongst these youth
ROC_se0_ag1_m_01_1_3347541_3368208 i don't it's it's i don't know it's it's somethi it's something about us like like you can hear somebody from the city and be like okay yeah they're from the city but like you hear somebody from rochester and you're like where they from
ROC_se0_ag1_m_01_1_3413916_3427781 i don't know like i think to me everybody in rochester pretty much be speaking english or they're not from rochester so that's understandable that they have an accent or like english is not their first speaking language cause i mean we have
ROC_se0_ag1_m_01_1_3459295_3468601 but it's i think with rochester it's more so like because of what our city gets portrayed as
ROC_se0_ag1_m_02_1_1404369_1412561 i need your music on right now before i can have my nice night tonight you know what i mean so it's cool like they're not just bumping down south music they do respect our sound
ROC_se0_ag1_m_02_1_164419_197782 well one friend that i still have his name me and him been friends ever since babies cause our moms were friends um he was like the chubby fat k fat dude then he started playing football and slimmed up it was a dude named he was a older dude like probably like four years older than us and we all like looked up to him cause he was like the like the east high school football player and like he used to train us out in the field and we used to like play like like t like shoot 'em up bust 'em up like basically like football freehand football yeah i had some pretty cool friends on court
ROC_se0_ag1_m_03_1_1325836_1333639 it's beautiful it was beautiful how things come together like that you know so now yeah it's
ROC_se0_ag1_m_03_1_2731369_2750996 i mean geechee is like basically like um like a southern accent um and which a lot of us in rochester already sound quote unquote geechee because a lot of us was raised by folks that lived down south
ROC_se0_ag1_m_03_1_2810906_2818522 or or way that we say things um and that's the that's to me that's what that's what s geechee is to me
ROC_se0_ag1_m_03_1_2977116_2990720 it's it'll work out it'll work out but yeah that's what people i guess that's what people think about uh those that speak like they're from down south but they was raised up here
ROC_se0_ag2_f_02_1_1720121_1726612 oh yeah that's what i told her i said like we were looking at the rental house she's like oh my god i said don't worry i'm buying a house you won't have to
ROC_se0_ag2_f_02_1_2165127_2184916 i am not and i feel like if you are an involved parent with your kid's education they're going to be successful wherever they are it's just the element and the environment that i want changed like in they're getting kicked out of their building for her sixth grade year who knows like if they're at franklin she ain't going there
ROC_se0_ag2_f_02_1_2640085_2645206 it really is like i lived in greece for three years i'll never forget because you're going to laugh
ROC_se0_ag2_f_02_1_2901032_2936926 she was born in a little town in georgia and everybody there if we if we go because uh we have family members that go every year we're related to every damn body in this little baby town like it's a very small town and they came up there f with um my mother's oldest sister she passed her husband came up here to sell drugs so he moved the whole my grandmother like my aunt said i'm not going without my family so he moved my grandmother and all her kids up here in order to get his wife to come up th here with him
ROC_se0_ag2_f_03_1_1240617_1251125 i've i've uh looked at u of r and r i t um what i find is that most of them want you to have college experience which is frustrating cause i'm not looking for teaching jo roles
ROC_se0_ag2_f_03_1_1750135_1777007 and even within our communities even gay black men versus um g um gay queer black women there's still some you know differences there's still um some needs to some need to have separate spaces or spaces that satisfy both you know and so um again i think gets it and he's trying to p create those spaces you know
ROC_se0_ag2_f_03_1_211669_223270 i'd love for businesses to be in the city and we deserve good restaurants and you know they all move out of our neighborhoods and now that i see what's happening i'm like wait a minute
ROC_se0_ag2_f_03_1_2266432_2313606 yep and we all you know we're all guilty of some type of collusion or you know whatever it takes to survive we've all had to swallow our pride at some point and so i'm not judgmental at all um and i think we and and and i don't know where you are in your journey but a lot of us carry guilt um because in one sense it's your responsibility to stand up in another sense you need to survive and these folks aren't you know into explanation you know you just need your paycheck and so what are you willing to put up with in order to pay your bills
ROC_se0_ag2_f_03_1_2341457_2355436 um but i have had a handful of days at my company that were you know my blackness was you know bleeding
ROC_se0_ag2_f_03_1_2571104_2580940 um activism you know i see 's group i see um the group b l a k c k um black
ROC_se0_ag2_f_03_1_2989460_3013623 um my wife points it out she says o w as soon as i get on the phone with my family or she said we can be driving to their house and my my language changes and without even thinking about it and she's like it happens automatically cause i don't pay attention to it um but the way i speak changes when i'm around um my family or predominantly around people of color
ROC_se0_ag2_f_03_1_379589_427006 i don't think so i think they are just trying to make more room and space for their students and trying to make it attractive to the folks that they are um reaching out to and so this whole push for safer spaces and building you know this whole perception that you're in the city the u of r but it might not be safe and so they're taking up real estate that is exclusive to the folks that they're catering to and that's how it feels to me but that's without any data i don't know what attempts u of r um has at uh my parents live a couple of blocks from u of r i don't think they've reached out at all i don't think but who knows um if there is something in the works i'm not aware of it
ROC_se0_ag2_f_03_1_39270_63728 i would describe it as inner city i mean i grew up um i'm thirty nine now but when i grew up it was the g boys and the black mob and you know it's a you know between jen cottage street was pretty a lot of homeowners but genesee and jefferson um a lot of uh just um activity uh around but also a very pretty area um a lot of old homes a lot of
ROC_se0_ag2_f_04_1_193297_198300 well you know the class of of of of nineteen ninety was probably the best last graduat no
ROC_se0_ag2_f_04_1_469678_515980 i tease him that he should have uh when i first met him i thought his family was west indian cause you know i wasn't sophisticated enough to be able to tell dialects at that time and i only knew florida and georgia and that's a very different sounding um tone so when i first heard his mother and his her his uncle speak and she would say things and i was like is his mother west indian and then i found out they're from south carolina and then just like daughters of the dust and um mama day and reading about the ugh those sea coast islands and just really being caught up in the beauty of the language so i tease him that he probably should have been educated as an e s l student because in many ways his his parents have this heavy hi his mother and his siblings i mean her siblings have this heavy speech pattern that i hear him say tha i'm like yeah you know i said really
ROC_se0_ag3_f_01_1_1341401_1376200 um that's basically it once they um both got jobs then you know they were out on their own and then they had an apartment on then they bought an apa had an apartment on then they bought this house so they actually bought the house for seventeen thousand dollars six bedroom house three bathrooms seventeen thousand year you know back then so that was crazy you so they payed their house off real quick because she was at kodak and he was in construction so it was basically a steal
ROC_se0_ag3_f_01_1_74615_80900 yeah so now my neighbors are great i actually have um kids from r i t next door
ROC_se0_ag3_f_02_1_1053864_1089199 i stayed with my grandmother until i was thirteen so when we first got up when i f when she first got here and to take me to school it was number school on avenue it's on avenue now but the r original was on avenue so i was go to f fifth grade and they said i couldn't uh cause i was coming from the south and she said she going to fifth grade
ROC_se0_ag3_f_02_1_1615257_1622185 or we'd stay at my house and that's the way we grew up so we grew up like sisters
ROC_se0_ag3_f_02_1_1699087_1707565 if if it was that high and i would take that take them shoes to school with me and change 'em on my way there
ROC_se0_ag3_f_02_1_2221266_2232596 with all the crinolines on there i remember that skirt i would wear it every friday and it had like a carousel around it i couldn't dance but i could twirl
ROC_se0_ag3_f_02_1_2471400_2503647 restaurant somewhere else where did he go i don't know where he went but eventually he was up on central avenue up with th all the hot dogs but he was on the corner of north street and central avenue and from there he moved cross town on clarissa street and from there he moved here where did he he was somewhere
ROC_se0_ag3_f_02_1_2528873_2546883 and she never recovered she was in uh the episcopal home she never recovered and that affected him and his health kind of went down too so i think somebody moved him out to arizona or something and that's where he died
ROC_se0_ag3_f_02_1_2579639_2587011 i wish i could remember where he was before he moved to thurston but i that's
ROC_se0_ag3_f_02_1_3084760_3095984 before you get to the concession stand and then you could go in and find a seat and i liked cause i could sit upstairs or i could sit downstairs
ROC_se0_ag3_f_02_1_3098829_3122479 and that was that was really nice my grandmother and i came up here yeah they had the r k o palace the r k o temple the r k o the other one was on east avenue oh it was so many movies um i lost my train of thought
ROC_se0_ag3_f_02_1_3135582_3162790 and at the movie when you went then you got a choice of you you always had two full length movies and you had i don't know how many cartoons then you had the coming attractions you had uh what they call serials which was chapters and and you always had a western you got all of that for your money
ROC_se0_ag3_f_02_1_708252_721458 i think cause in the old days you didn't i s like i said i don't know if it was consensual they was going behind the bend somewhere or if he was forcing hisself and she was scared
